Years ago humanity took the first steps on the moon. This couldnâ€™t have happened without the courage of people who risked their lives to fulfil the human desire to reach the moon. The above quote is a part of the Air-to-Ground voice transmission from the Apollo 11 mission.

__The story of the moon__ is an artwork that is built literally using the transcription of that technical communication. It demonstrates all the sensitive, stressful and joyful moments of the successful landing by Armstrong, Collins and ALdrin.

The original file is a __390-megapixel (22550x17300)__ image that allows you to zoom in all over it and read the whole transcribed communication.
